### Hello, my name is Tina 👋🏽 

🎓 I recently graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science & Tech Management @ UCD. (Dec 2022)

📚 I believe that I have a solid foundation in the core principles of CS with relevant coursework in Data Structure, Algorithm Design & Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Network. 

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as an AI Software Engineer that impacts billions around the world.

⚡ Fun fact about me, I have never watched any of Star Wars sequel trilogy.

🏔 In my free time, you can find me hiking or rock climbing in the nature with my dog.

💪🏽  I am comfortable working with individuals and groups to provide them with the guidance they need to achieve their goals, and I am confident that my problem solving, teamwork, and time-management skills will serve me well in teams.
