### Hello, my name is Tina 👋🏽 

🎓 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Tech Management @ UCD. (Dec 2022)

📚 I believe that I have a solid foundation in the core principles of CS with relevant coursework in Data Structure, Algorithm Design & Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Networks. 

🚀 I am specialized in: `Python`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript` and `HTML/CSS`.

⚡ Fun fact about me, I have never watched any of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.

🏔 In my free time, you can find me hiking or rock climbing in nature with my dog.

💪🏽 I am comfortable working with individuals and groups to provide them with the guidance they need to achieve their goals, and I am confident that my problem-solving, teamwork, and time-management skills will serve me well in teams.
