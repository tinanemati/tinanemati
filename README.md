### Hello, my name is Tina 👋🏽 

🎓 I recently graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science & Tech Management @ UCD. (Dec 2022)

📚 I believe that I have a solid foundation in the core principles of CS with relevant coursework in Data Structure, Algorithm Design & Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Network. 

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as an AI Software Engineer that impacts billions around the world.
